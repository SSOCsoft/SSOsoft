SSOsoft
=======

Data reduction tools for the Sunspot Solar Observatory
Consortium.


Features
--------

At present, SSOsoft is a simple-to-use class to calibrate
and prepare ROSA and HaRDcam data from the Sunspot Solar
Observatory. At present, full ROSA functionality is not
supported, but SSOsoft is able to produce the necessary
image bursts for processing with the Kiepenheuer-Institut
Speckle Interferometry Package (KISIP, F. Woeger, National
Solar Observatory).


To do
-----

	* Implement seamless end-to-end calibration by developing
	a container class for running KISIP.
	* Generalize tools to allow SSOsoft to be able to reduce
	ROSA data.


Future
------

SSOsoft will be able to run other SSOC data reduction
pipelines for IBIS, SPINOR, and FIRS datasets.
