SSOsoft is a set of tools for reducing data from the
Sunspot Solar Observatory.


Features
--------

At present, SSOsoft is a simple-to-use class to calibrate
and prepare ROSA and HaRDcam data from the Sunspot Solar
Observatory. The full ROSA functionality is not yet
supported. SSOsoft is able to produce all of the necessary
HaRDcam image bursts for processing with the
Kiepenheuer-Institut Speckle Interferometry Package (KISIP,
F. Woeger, National Solar Observatory).

+---------------------------------------------------------+

To do
-----
	
	* Develop tests for file I/O opterations and data
	descriptors.
	* Implement seamless end-to-end calibration by developing
	a container class for running KISIP.
	* Generalize tools to allow SSOsoft to be able to reduce
	ROSA data.


Future
------

SSOsoft will be able to run other SSOC data reduction
pipelines for IBIS, SPINOR, and FIRS datasets.

Software requirements
---------------------

Python 3.x
Matplotlib
NumPy
Astropy


How to use
----------

Using SSOsoft is easy.

	* Create a configuration file in ini syntax (see the
	included sample for reference).
	* Open a python terminal.
	* import ssosoft
	* Create an instance of the RosaHardCamCal(<config file>),
	where <config file> is a string containing the location of
	the ini file created in the first step.
	* Run the rosa_hardcam_run_calibration() method.
	* Have a look at other methods in the class if you would
	like to customize your calibration run.
