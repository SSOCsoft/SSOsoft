SSOsoft is a set of tools for reducing data from the
Sunspot Solar Observatory.


Features
--------

SSOsoft is a simple-to-use python class to calibrate
and prepare ROSA and Zyla data from the Sunspot Solar
Observatory. The full ROSA functionality is not yet
supported. SSOsoft is able to produce all of the necessary
Zyla image bursts for speckle analysis with the
Kiepenheuer-Institut Speckle Interferometry Package (KISIP,
F. Woeger, National Solar Observatory).

| +-----------------------------------------------------+ |
+---------------------------------------------------------+


To do
-----
	
	* Develop a test for the integrity of automatic image shape
	detection results.
	* Integrate header info for ROSA and Zyla datasets.


Known Bugs
----------

	* Noise file always written even if no noise file is
	computed.


Future
------

SSOsoft will be able to run other SSOC data reduction
pipelines for IBIS, SPINOR, and FIRS datasets.


Acknowledgements
----------------

We appreciate all the hard work done by the following
people, without whom this project would have been a lot
harder.

	* Christian Beck, National Solar Observatory.
	* David Jess, Queens University, Belfast.
	* Friedrich Woeger, National Solar Observatory.


Software and Hardware Requirements
----------------------------------

Linux Operating System
Intel/AMD CPU
Python 3.x
Matplotlib
NumPy
Astropy


How to use
----------

Using SSOsoft is easy.

	* Create a configuration file in ini syntax (see the
	included sample for reference).
	* Open a python terminal.
	* import ssosoft
	* Create an instance of the RosaZylaCal(<config file>)
	class, where <config file> is a string containing the
	location of the ini file created in the first step.
	* Run the rosa_zyla_run_zyla_calibration() method.
	* Monitor the log file `<time>_zyla.log' to see intermediate
	reduction steps.
	* Take a look at the average dark, average flat, gain, and
	noise images output in FITS format.
	* Have a look at other methods in the class if you would
	like to customize your calibration run.
